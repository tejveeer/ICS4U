1. Initial Tutorial ([Build Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc)) 

2. Currently looking into CSS and HTML specifications to better understand syntax
   1.  [HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#metadata-content)
   2.  [CSS specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference), [CSS selectors specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#syntax)

3. Will be working on **MDN CSS** now as the tutorials are inadequate in terms of providing depth of understanding
a. Completed *CSS first steps*

4. Reading **CSS in Depth** alongside MDN
   1. Completed chapter on *Cascading* which included specificity and inheritance. Specificity of selectors is determined by the kind of selectors it has within it; id > class > tag. Higher specificity selectors are selected for styling elements.

### Important Quotes
> In CSS, selectors are defined in the CSS Selectors specification; like any other part of CSS they need to have support in browsers for them to work. The majority of selectors that you will come across are defined in the Level 3 Selectors specification and Level 4 Selectors specification, which are both mature specifications, therefore you will find excellent browser support for these selectors.
