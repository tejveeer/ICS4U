<!-- 
    Experimenting with selectors and combinators 
    Selectors seem to be 'selecting' a domain of elements over which you can apply a certain style.
    Combinators seem to be operations on the level of domains themselves.

<style>
    * { background-color: pink; }

    /* > seems to be selecting first-child elements of the parent element */
    div > a { background-color: yellow; }
    /* 
    un-specified operator combinator seems to be looking recursively for the child-element in the parent-element.
    Perhaps also has a higher specificity than the selector configuration above. 
    */
    div a { background-color: aqua;}

    /* Note: there is a significant difference between this and when > operator is included. I'm wondering now whether there can be chained > operators to perform n-depth level search of parents*/

    /* 
    I assumed this would be understood as "select all first-level ul children of div with `a` as their children", however, it seems to be parsed
    However, it seems to be parsed otherwise. Perhaps it could be a specificity problem, I'll have a look. Yes it is specificity problem. Time to look at how specificity is calculated.
