## Current Understanding
An understanding of web development seems to be related to understanding the relation between the three languages: HTML, CSS and Javascript. Currently, I understand HTML to be the structural aspect of the website, and CSS to be designating its appearance -- or more accurately, behavior. Then, even more fundamentally, javscript seems to be the behavior of the HTML-CSS components in various states. Thus the relationship between the languages seems to be a representation of behavior: HTML is structure, CSS is behavior of structural aspects, and Javascript is behavior of behavior of structural aspects.

The current task is to sufficiently understand the construction of the structure as well as its corresponding behavior; thus HTML and CSS.
