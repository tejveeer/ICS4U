# ICS4U
This repository will be used to store all the content that I'll be going through within this course. The purpose of this is just to organize all the things neatly.

## Current Plan
1. Work on learning web dev (html, css/scss, javascript/typescript, bootstrap, react, nodejs) for the purpose of volunteer work and personal blog. (**Deadline**: April)
2. Learn rust and how to make a parser/lexer for the purpose of creating my own database.
   1. Perhaps research Ethereum smart contracts and how to work with them with rust.
3. Continue my study of functional programming languages and category theory

This indeed sounds quite a lot of work, and possibly out of scope for the current time, but I certainly can give it a try. The main goal, however, will be #1, unless plans change. The course summative should be trivial enough to complete during class time so it shouldn't be a major problem.
